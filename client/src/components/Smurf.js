//Task List:
//1. Access smurf to be displayed through props.
//2. Display the name, position, nickname and description of the provided smurf as needed.
//3. Style as needed. (feel free to make use of the bootstrap card structure: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/)
//4. DO NOT DELETE THE data-testid FIELD! It is used for sprint grading.
