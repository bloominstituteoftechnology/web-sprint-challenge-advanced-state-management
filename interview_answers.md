# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What problem does the context API help solve?
 CLEANER CODE, EASIER TO PASS AROUND DATA TO LOWER COMPONENTS
2. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?
ACTIONS ARE THE THINGS THAT ACT ON STATE WHEN THERES A CHANGE IN STATE IT IS AN ACTION. REDUCERS ARE WHERE WE SETUP ARE CASES AND INITIALSTATE AND WOULD ACT ON STATE, STORE IS WHERE THE STATE I STORED AT THE TOP LEVEL ITS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH BECAUSE IT IS IMMUTABLE AND IT HOLDS ALL GLOBAL STATE
3. What does `redux-thunk` allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?
 DISPATCH MULTIPLE ACTIONS
4. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!
I ENJOYED ALL OF THEM REALLY. I WOULD SAY CONTEXT API IS A LITTLE EASIER TO WORK WITH.
